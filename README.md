# Simple Shell

## Description
The Simple Shell project is a basic implementation of a Unix shell. It provides a command-line interface for users to interact with the operating system by executing commands.

## Features
- Command execution
- Built-in commands (e.g., `cd`, `exit`)
- Input redirection
- Output redirection
- Piping between commands

## Installation
To install and run the Simple Shell, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/a3ela/simple_shell.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd simple_shell
    ```
3. Compile the source code:
    ```sh
    gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o hsh
    ```
4. Run the shell:
    ```sh
    ./hsh
    ```

## Usage
Once the shell is running, you can enter commands just like you would in a standard Unix shell. For example:
```sh
$ ls -l
$ pwd
$ echo "Hello, world!"
```
